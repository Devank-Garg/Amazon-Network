# Exploring the Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network: A Social Network Analysis Approach

In this project, we dive into the Amazon product co-purchasing network to explore the connections between products and identify key patterns and communities within the network. 
By leveraging social network analysis techniques, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the product network's structure, identify influential products, and uncover potential clusters or communities of related items.

# Usage
1. Run "Amazon_Co-purchased Product Analysis.ipynb"
* Make Sure You Have The CSV Files I have Provided


# Dataset
We utilize a large-scale dataset obtained from Amazon, which contains information about customer purchases and the co-purchasing relationships between products. 
The dataset includes attributes such as product IDs, customer IDs, purchase timestamps, and additional metadata about the products.

Raw Data can be obtained from:-- [Stanford's Network Datasets](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/#amazon)

# Methodology
- analysis involves several key steps:

1. Data preprocessing: We perform data cleaning and transformation to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for network analysis.
2. Network construction: We construct a co-purchasing network by representing products as nodes and connecting them based on their co-purchasing relationships.
3. Network analysis: We apply various social network analysis techniques to explore the structural properties of the co-purchasing network. This includes measuring      centrality, identifying communities or clusters, and examining network connectivity.
4. Visualization: We visualize the co-purchasing network and its key properties to provide a clear representation of the relationships between products and any identified patterns or communities.
